###How To Play

To take a turn, either spin the wheel, buy a vowel, or solve the puzzle.  
*  Once you spin, a value will appear next to the spin button and you must choose a letter. 
Your score will increase according to how many times the letter occurs in the puzzle.
If the letter doesn't exist in the puzzle, you will lose your turn.  
*  Vowels cost 500 points. If you don't have enough points, you must spin or solve.  
*  To solve the puzzle, click the \"Solve Puzzle\" button and type in your answer.
A correct answer wins the game and an incorrect answer loses a turn.  

Good luck and may the Schwartz be with you.
